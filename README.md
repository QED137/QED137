* **Computational Astrophysics:**  [Link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/N-Body)
* **Mass Transport Models And Applications:**  [Link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/ComputationalAstrophysics)
* **Cherenkov Gamma Telescope Event Classification:** [link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/Machine-Learning-Project-on-Cherenkov-gamma-telescope-)

**2. Machine Learning:**
This section showcases my machine learning projects utilizing various algorithms (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and data analysis tools (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn).
* **Machine-Learning-Project-on-Cherenkov-gamma-telescope:** [link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/Machine-Learning-Project-on-Cherenkov-gamma-telescope-)
* **Physics Informed Machine Learning:** [link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/PIML)
* **Computer Vision Project:** [link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/ComputerVisionProject)
* **Machine Learning model for Higgs Boson:**[link to folder](https://github.com/QED137/HiggsBosonML) 


**3. Web Development:**
This section explores my web development skills, featuring both static websites (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and dynamic applications built with the Flask framework.
* **My Portfolio:** (Static Webpage only HTML/CSS/Javascript) [link to MyPage](https://qed137.github.io/) [link to GitHub ](https://github.com/QED137/QED137.github.io)
* **Full Stack Web Development:** Developed a dynamic job board prototype using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and a cloud-hosted MySQL database managed by SQLAlchemy, enabling users to search, apply, and view dynamically generated job postings.

  ***Please Note:***- Sometimes WebPage takes longer time than usual to load because I am using the free tier for both the database and deployment
 
**4. Fun Projects:**
This section is dedicated to projects fueled by my love of coding. Here, you'll find solutions to interesting math problems or applications I developed for the joy of exploration.
* **Collatz Conjecture:** Investigates the Collatz sequence's behavior through code [link for folder] (https://github.com/QED137/Collatz_conjecture)
* **Essential Statistics:** This section provides an introduction to essential statistical concepts needed to kickstart your understanding of data analysis. It includes course materials and relevant code examples. [link to three folders](https://github.com/QED137/EssentialStatistics)
