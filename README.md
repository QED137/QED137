This repository showcases my work in several areas, demonstrating my skills and interests in computational science, machine learning, and web development. 

### 1. Physics Simulations:

This section features a diverse collection of code from my Master's program, highlighting my expertise in computational physics and simulation techniques. Explore the projects in the following folders:

* **N-Bodies Simulation: Chaos In Planetary System:**  This code is part of coursework at TÃ¼bingen University from 2019 to 2021. [For Details](https://github.com/QED137/Mass-transport-models-and-their-applications)
* **Computational Astrophysics:**  This code is part of coursework at TÃ¼bingen University from 2019 to 2021.[For Details](https://github.com/QED137/N-Body)
* **Mass Transport Models And Applications:** This is my master's thesis in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India, from 2011 to 2013 [For Details](https://github.com/QED137/ComputationalAstrophysics)
* **Cherenkov Gamma Telescope Event Classification:** [For Details](https://github.com/QED137/Machine-Learning-Project-on-Cherenkov-gamma-telescope-)

### 2. Machine Learning:
This section showcases my machine learning projects utilizing various algorithms (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and data analysis tools (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn).
* **Machine-Learning-Project-on-Cherenkov-gamma-telescope:** [For Details](https://github.com/QED137/Machine-Learning-Project-on-Cherenkov-gamma-telescope-)

* **Computer Vision Project:** [For Details](https://github.com/QED137/ComputerVisionProject)
* **Machine Learning model for Higgs Boson:**[For Details](https://github.com/QED137/HiggsBosonML) 


### 3. Web Development:

This section explores my web development skills, featuring both static websites (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and dynamic applications built with the Flask framework.
* **My Portfolio:** (Static Webpage only HTML/CSS/Javascript) [link to MyPage](https://qed137.github.io/) [link to GitHub ](https://github.com/QED137/QED137.github.io)
* **Full Stack Web Development:** Developed a dynamic job board prototype using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and a cloud-hosted MySQL database managed by SQLAlchemy, enabling users to search, apply, and view dynamically generated job postings.
  [For Details](https://github.com/QED137/FlaskOnReplit) [Click here for full-stack webpage](https://web-development-with-flask.onrender.com/)
  ***Please Note:***- Sometimes WebPage takes longer time than usual to load because I am using the free tier for both the database and deployment
 
### 4. Fun Projects:
This section is dedicated to projects fueled by my love of coding. Here, you'll find solutions to interesting math problems or applications I developed for the joy of exploration.
* **Collatz Conjecture:** Investigates the Collatz sequence's behavior through code [ For Details](https://github.com/QED137/Collatz_conjecture)
