**3. Web Development:**
This section explores my web development skills, featuring both static websites (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and dynamic applications built with the Flask framework.
* **My Portfolio:** (Static Webpage only HTML/CSS/Javascript) [link to MyPage](https://qed137.github.io/) [link to GitHub ](https://github.com/QED137/QED137.github.io)
* **Full Stack Web Development:** Developed a dynamic job board prototype using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and a cloud-hosted MySQL database managed by SQLAlchemy, enabling users to search, apply, and view dynamically generated job postings.
